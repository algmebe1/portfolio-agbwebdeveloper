# :pencil2: My personal portfolio :speaker:

I have created this project as my portfolio website. I have used React with Hooks at Frontend and Express and Node including nodemailer for the contact form.

This first version has been deployed in Heroku.
You can visit the website at [https://portfolio-agbwebdeveloper.herokuapp.com/](https://portfolio-agbwebdeveloper.herokuapp.com/) in the browser.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
> from 'client' folder

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start`
> from root folder

Runs the server at port 5000.
This will allow to run logic to be the contact form functional.
